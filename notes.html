<!-- CAPSTONE PROJECTMain Objective: Build a mock website for a local Non-Profit with your group.Must Utilize HTML, CSS, JS (NO CMS: Squarespace, Wix, WordPress, etc)Must be done in a groupMust present as a group (date TBD)
You will be placed in groups and given a few options on non-profits that you will decide on with your group. Your end goal should be a complete site serving the purpose of the non-profit you chose. Teamwork is the key skill (and main takeaway from this project) and participation from all group members is required for the success of the project as well as receiving a Certificate of Completion. Similar to the portfolio site, there might be some functionalities that the time doesn’t allow for or you might lack the experience in what certain things require (ex: backend or other languages). Create the MVP (Most Viable Product)These will be uploaded to GitHub, deployed via GitHub Pages, and turned in via Google Forms in Classroom. -->
