                            <p><strong>Shyanna Howard, Elliott County PRIDE Coordinator, (606) 738-5821</strong></p>
                            <p>PRIDE Coordinators are volunteers who play a vital role in building PRIDE in communities across the region. The coordinators work directly with the PRIDE staff to schedule cleanup activities, recruit volunteers and track cleanup results. PRIDE Coordinators also assist local officials with the PRIDE programs, including applications.</p>
                            <p>PRIDE invites all mayors and county judge-executives in our 42 county service area to designate a PRIDE Coordinator. Some communities appoint two co-coordinators. In addition, nonprofit organizations that receive PRIDE grants also can appoint coordinators. The length of a PRIDE Coordinator's term of service is left to the discretion of his or her mayor or judge.</p>
                            <p>Please call your local PRIDE Coordinator to learn more about PRIDE in your community.</p>

                            <p>PRIDE Coordinators are volunteers who play a vital role in building PRIDE in communities across the region. The coordinators work directly with the PRIDE staff to schedule cleanup activities, recruit volunteers and track cleanup results. PRIDE Coordinators also assist local officials with the PRIDE programs, including applications.</p>
                            <p>PRIDE invites all mayors and county judge-executives in our 42 county service area to designate a PRIDE Coordinator. Some communities appoint two co-coordinators. In addition, nonprofit organizations that receive PRIDE grants also can appoint coordinators. The length of a PRIDE Coordinator's term of service is left to the discretion of his or her mayor or judge.</p>
                            <p>Please call your local PRIDE Coordinator to learn more about PRIDE in your community.</p>
