                    <h3>ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION GRANT PROGRAM</h3>
                    <p>
                        The PRIDE Environmental Education Grant program supports projects that help young people
                        understand the importance of a clean environment, personal responsibility and community pride. Projects emphasize hands-on activities, and students are encouraged to share their lessons and serve
                        their communities.

                        The one-year grants are available through an application process to schools, nonprofit
                        organizations and other educators in the 38 counties served by PRIDE.

                        The grant value varies annually, based on available funds. A monetary or in-kind match is
                        required.
                    </p>

                        The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, a founding partner in the PRIDE initiative, administers the
                        Section 531 program. Funds are available for wastewater projects that:

                        Demonstrate innovative wastewater treatment approaches,
                        Serve rural areas not likely to be addressed in the near future by other traditional funding
                        sources, or
                        Have secured funding from other sources but still need a small amount of financial assistance to
                        be implemented
                        This program awards 75% of the project's cost, and the grant recipient must provide the
                        remaining 25%.

                        Eligible applicants are counties, cities, wastewater utilities and nonprofit organizations in
